# userdata: system for user authentication and data storage.
# This is the server program, which manages the data.

'''
Interface: {{{

Terminology:
	- user: human owner of managed data.
	- player: human person to who the managed data applies, who may or may not also be the owner of that data.
	- browser: program through which users and players interact with their game server and the userdata server.
	- userdata server: this program, it manages the data for several users and several games.
	- game server: a program that provides a game interface to players and connects to one or more userdata servers to store its data.
	- token: a cryptographically hard to guess string that allows access to a user's data. The user receives it after logging in and should pass it to the game server.

Game protocol:
	- login_game()		At boot, the game server connects to its userdata to store game data. This also allows access to all data from players stored under that user.
	-			When a player connects to the game, a userdata server is selected based on the game settings (with/without default; allow-local, allow-external)
	- login_{user,player}()	Player connects to userdata and logs in, receiving a token
	-			Browser notifies game server that login was successful and which userdata was used, plus an access token.
	- login_token()		Game server connects to the userdata (or uses existing connection) and provides the token
	-			Game server uses the connection to handle player data.

Data management protocol:
	- Option 1: User connects directly to userdata and logs in
	- Option 2: User logs in through a game that allows external userdata, then selects "manage data".
	Both options need login_user() to be used. login_player() does not allow access to the data.
	Data management browser interface still needs to be designed.
	Alternatively, when logging in through a program, regular database commands can be used.

Possible connections to userdata server (this program):

From game:	self.game = (game_id, ...); self.user = username or None; self.manage = False
	- login_game(game_info, name = None, password = None): set game info for login_token; use game data if credentials are supplied. Set self.game = game_info
	- login_token(token, player_id): return player name; use data for player that provided the token. Login_game must always be called first; this can be called multiple times to share the connection for multiple players. Set self.player[id] = (username, None) or (username, playername)
	- logout(player_id): Remove player from list of accessible data.
	- [db_access](game_id, player_id, ...): All db access uses the player id as first argument. It should be set to None for the game data.

From user:	self.game = None; self.user = username; self.manage = True
	- login_user(name, password): manage user data; full access. Set self.user = name.
	- list_games(): return all games that have data (index in this list is the game_id for this connection)
	- list_players(game_id): return all valid players (stored under this user) for the game.
	- [db_access](game_id, player_id, ...): same interface as from game

From player:	self.game = None; self.user = username; self.player = playername or None; self.manage = False
	- login_user(name, password, game_info): return token. Connection is closed when game provides token. Token is invalidated if this connection is closed before it is used. This connection can be used for data management until the token is used. Set server.player[token] = self.
	- login_player(username, playername, password, game_info): return token; same as above, use player account inside user's data. Set server.player[token] = self.

Database format:

All tables have a prefix if set on the commandline using --prefix.
User tables have an additional (after the global prefix) prefix of 'username-gamename-playername-'.
The [gamename]-prefix is the [game1]-field in the user table (not the id provided by the game itself).
For game data and for login_user()-data, playername is "". In other words, the prefix is 'username-gamename--'.
The userdata server never changes user tables except as asked by authorized users.
Internal data is (all tables have the global prefix):
	user: name, game_id, games, password, email	(if games is NULL, this is the master login for the user; otherwise it is a tab-separated list of games (in a string))
	[username]-[gamename]-user: name, password, email
